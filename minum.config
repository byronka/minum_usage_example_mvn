### The port used for our plain, non-secure server

SERVER_PORT=8080


### the port for our secure, TLS 1.3 server

SSL_SERVER_PORT=8443


### the name of our host on the internet.  Used by our
### system when it needs to build a self-referencing URL.

HOST_NAME=localhost


# database top-level directory

DB_DIRECTORY=out/simple_db

# static files top-level directory

STATIC_FILES_DIRECTORY=src/main/webapp/static/

### The log levels are:
###
### Related to the business purposes of the application.  That is,
### the very highest-level, perhaps least-common logging messages.
### AUDIT
###
### Information useful for debugging.
### DEBUG
###
###
### Most often, indicates an error resulting from a bug in the program.
### These should be taken very seriously - fix them when found.
### ASYNC_ERROR
###
###
### Information marked as trace is pretty much entered for
### the same reason as DEBUG - i.e. so we can see important
### information about the running state of the program. The
### only difference is that trace information is very voluminous.
### That is, there's tons of it, and it could make it harder
### to find the important information amongst a lot of noise.
### For that reason, TRACE is usually turned off.
### TRACE
###
### list them here, separated by commas

### This property is to switch between using OS-level threads or
### the more-recent virtual threads feature in Java (see https://openjdk.org/jeps/425)

USE_VIRTUAL=true


### This property will cause the insecure endpoint to serve solely as a
### redirector to the secure endpoint.

REDIRECT_TO_SECURE=false


### This value is sent out for browsers to use.
### It is the length of time, in seconds, for static files to be cached,
### per the provisions of the Cache-Control header, e.g.
###
###   "Cache-Control: max-age=" + STATIC_FILE_CACHE_TIME
###

STATIC_FILE_CACHE_TIME=300


### TheBrig (TheBrig.java) manages a collection of identifiers
### for attackers of our system.  Disabling it here will cause it
### to abdicate its job - mainly for testing purposes - probably
### performance testing.
IS_THE_BRIG_ENABLED=false


### This property lets the user add mappings between file suffixes
### and mime types.  For example, "png" to "image/png" or whatever.
### See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types
###
### Try to follow the syntax here - be careful - the syntax is fragile. It
### goes like this: key,value,key,value,... but a backslash at the end of
### a line lets us break into multiple lines
EXTRA_MIME_MAPPINGS=\
png,image/png, \
wav,audio/wav

### These are error messages that arrive to the server code
### when an unusual request arrives, potentially signifying an attack.
### Do note that several of these are likely to show up if you
### are running testing tools against the app.
### also, understand that while our code may interpret
### a request as an attack, nothing else will happen unless TheBrig
### is enabled, in which case the offender will be added to a list
### and denied connection.
SUSPICIOUS_ERRORS= \
Insufficient buffer remaining for AEAD cipher fragment,\

The ClientHello.legacy_version field is not TLS 1.2,\
Client requested protocol SSLv3 is not enabled or supported in server context,\

### Similar to the property "suspiciousErrors", these endpoints
### are often associated with attackers, and will immediately
### result in being deemed as such.

### These are safety values - we don't want to accept infinite values,

### with broken clients.

### How long we will wait before closing a connection, if we are
### on a keep-alive connection.  The default value is probably fine
### in most cases.

#KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=


### a timeout, in milliseconds, for TCP sockets. If this value
### is a positive integer, the socket will block for that length
### of time.  If zero, it is interpreted as an infinite timeout
### This is a good option to consider if you are doing debugging -
### it is much easier to debug without a timeout interrupting
### your work.  That is to say, this might be set to zero for
### local debugging, and cleared or set to some positive value
### for production.

#SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MILLIS=


### length of time, in milliseconds, bad actors will be prevented
### from connecting.

#VULN_SEEKING_JAIL_DURATION=


### here is another option you might adjust to improve local
### debugging and feature development.  The default is true,
### because it has nice performance to use a cache for all
### static files.  But, if you set this to false in local
### development, it will not cache anything, meaning that
### every adjustment to a static file (e.g. css, js files)
### will be immediately sent from the server.  Of course, you
### still need to consider any potential caching on the browser.

#USE_CACHE_FOR_STATIC_FILES=


### This defines how many static files we will store in a LRU
### cache in our program.  This means all static files like
### css or js files, and static images, will get stored in this
### cache, up to a maximum count as set here.  This is a bit
### of a function of how many static files you expect to have
### in combination with how large those files are.  The more
### in the cache, the more memory it takes.  In many cases,
### there should not be too much concern, but here is a dial
### for it, just in case.

#MAX_ELEMENTS_LRU_CACHE_STATIC_FILES=
